# HW3 Code

Here is where I developed the code for homework one, which was exploring matrix-vector optimization methods. 
Code was compiled using `g++ matrixVectorMultiplication.cpp -o matrixVectorMultiplication`.

All methods for experimental methods (i.e. contiguous memory, loop unrolling, compiler optimizations) are stored in `matrixVectorMultiplication.cpp`, and I ran experiments by changing the `main.cpp` function. 
I also have a function to generate the Latex tables seen in the report.
